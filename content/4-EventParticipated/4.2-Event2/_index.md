# Report: ‚ÄúAI-Driven Development Lifecycle: Reimagining Software Engineering‚Äù

### Event Objectives

- Understand how AI can automate and optimize stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- Embrace the philosophy of AI augmenting humans rather than replacing them in the software development process.
- Observe how tools like Amazon Q and other AI assistants support developers from ideation and code generation to infrastructure deployment (IaC).
- Learn about the emerging trend of ‚ÄúAI-first development,‚Äù where AI becomes a natural part of future dev workflows.

### Speakers

- **Toan Huynh**
- **My Nguyen**

### Highlights

#### Challenges of programming with AI

The introduction covered the limitations and challenges of applying AI to programming:

- AI still struggles with projects that require deep domain knowledge and complex business logic.
- Developers can have limited control over generated code when prompts and scope are not well-defined.
- The quality of generated code depends heavily on the prompt and context provided to the model.

This motivates the AI-DLC approach: creating a structured process to help AI and humans collaborate more effectively.

#### How AI is changing software development

This section analyzed how AI is transforming the software industry:

- AI assists code generation, technical documentation, API design, and automated testing.
- Developers shift roles from ‚Äúcode writers‚Äù to ‚ÄúAI orchestrators‚Äù who guide, evaluate, and refine AI outputs.
- Tools like Amazon Q, GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for Developers become central parts of modern development workflows.

#### üîπ What is AI-DLC

AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) is an AI-augmented software development approach where each stage is designed to provide AI with specific context and goals to produce more accurate results.

üüß Inception

1. Build Context on Existing Code ‚Äì feed AI the current codebase so it understands project structure.
2. Elaborate Intent with User Stories ‚Äì developers describe requirements via user stories to clarify goals.
3. Plan with Units of Work ‚Äì break work into small units the AI can execute and generate code for.

üü¶ Construction

4. Domain Model (Component Model) ‚Äì build domain models or architecture diagrams.
5. Generate Code & Test ‚Äì AI generates code and tests based on the plan.
6. Add Architectural Components ‚Äì add API layers, data layers, logging, and security components.
7. Deploy with IaC & Tests ‚Äì automate deployment using Infrastructure as Code and integration tests.

_üîÅ Each stage provides richer context for the next, helping AI produce increasingly accurate outputs._

#### Core Concepts

1. Context Awareness ‚Äì AI needs clear context about code, requirements, and domain to work well.
2. Collaborative Generation ‚Äì humans and AI collaborate: AI generates code, humans direct and verify outputs.
3. Continuous Refinement ‚Äì iterative cycles to refine outputs and improve quality.

#### Mob Elaboration

Mob Elaboration is a collaborative method for elaborating intents:

- Multiple participants contribute user stories, questions, and additional context for the AI.
- It helps AI gain deeper understanding of domain, goals, and complex logic.
- This approach reduces the risk of misunderstandings‚Äîespecially in large or cross-domain teams.

#### The 5-Stage Sequential Process of AI-DLC

AI-DLC runs through 5 phases:

1. Inception ‚Äì understand requirements and analyze the system.
2. Construction ‚Äì create domain models and initial structure.
3. Generation ‚Äì automated code generation.
4. Testing ‚Äì automated unit and integration testing.
5. Deployment ‚Äì deploy applications with IaC and CI/CD pipelines.

Each loop improves the AI's outputs through incremental learning and feedback.

#### Demo 1 ‚Äì Interactive AI-DLC experience with Amazon Q

The demo showcased AI-DLC in practice with a small project:

- Start from a simple idea and turn it into a user story describing business requirements.
- AI helps split tasks into Units of Work and plans implementation details for each module.
- Attendees interact with AI using questions, checkboxes, and logical conditions to clarify scope.
- AI generates code, tests, project structure, and executes trial deployments.
- The demo illustrated smooth collaboration between AI and humans: AI performs repetitive generation while humans steer and make decisions.

#### Introducing Kiro

Philosophy of Kiro

The workshop introduced Kiro, an intelligent development environment built around the idea of ‚ÄúAI-native development‚Äù where AI is a core collaborator rather than just a tool.

Kiro‚Äôs philosophy emphasizes three points:

1. Deep integration with the development process ‚Äì AI participates in planning, context management, and impact analysis.
2. Comprehensive project context ‚Äì Kiro maintains ongoing awareness of project structure so AI can interact with the whole project rather than single files.
3. Intelligent control & collaboration ‚Äì developers guide AI via contextual commands so each change has clear intent and consistency.

This makes Kiro more than a code generator: it is an ecosystem for collaborative human‚ÄìAI development.

Project structure in Kiro

Unlike traditional text editors like VSCode or JetBrains, Kiro is an AI-aware workspace with structural awareness.

Its project model includes:

- Context Layer ‚Äì stores context, domain models, and relationships among modules.
- Task Layer ‚Äì manages Units of Work tracked and executed by AI.
- AI Agent Layer ‚Äì agents handle specific tasks (code, tests, refactor, deploy) enabling a multi-agent collaborative model.
- Human-in-the-Loop Control ‚Äì developers can confirm, modify, or reject AI outputs at any stage.

Kiro therefore becomes an ecosystem for coordinated human‚ÄìAI development rather than just a code editor.

#### Demo 2: Kiro in practice

In the demonstration, the presenters showed how Kiro implements AI-DLC:

1. User provides a basic business requirement like ‚Äúbuild an event management system.‚Äù
2. Kiro analyzes intent, creates a domain model, and splits work into user stories.
3. AI generates modules, components, and corresponding test cases.
4. Developers interact with a checkbox-based task control to approve each unit of work.
5. Kiro finally deploys the completed system using IaC and automated tests.

The demo proved AI-DLC is practical: AI, human operators, and processes integrate into a single coherent workflow.

### Event experience

Attending the workshop ‚ÄúAI DLC x Kiro: Reinventing Developer Experience with AI‚Äù was highly valuable, clarifying how AI can be deeply embedded into the developer experience and how Kiro‚Äôs design offers a fresh approach for developers.

#### Insights from expert speakers

- Speakers presented AI-DLC as a platform that automates many SDLC tasks and supports software development using AI.
- The Kiro introduction gave a perspective on designing an AI-native text editor rather than adding AI plugins to legacy editors.
- I was particularly impressed by Kiro‚Äôs philosophy: minimalism, high performance, user-focused experience, and modular extensibility.

#### Practical technical takeaways

- The demo showed how AI-DLC and Kiro can create, refactor, and optimize code efficiently.
- A small starter project was created and managed within Kiro, demonstrating auto-refactoring, test generation and logic analysis.
- Compared to editors like VSCode and Sublime, Kiro stands out for its AI-first architecture and lightweight plugin model that preserves performance.

#### Modern tooling and potential applications

- Experiencing AI-DLC on Kiro highlighted the potential to automate development workflows‚Äîespecially code generation, documentation, and debugging.
- I saw opportunities to build personal learning and productivity tools that provide smart suggestions and accelerate development.
- Kiro‚Äôs modular design inspires approaches to building flexible, maintainable systems.

#### Networking and discussions

- The workshop offered chances to connect with developers, AI researchers, and product designers, deepening my understanding of AI-augmented development.
- Discussions helped me see AI as a creative collaborator, allowing developers to focus more on system logic and architecture.

#### Key lessons

- AI-DLC combined with Kiro is a model for next-generation development tools‚ÄîAI-first IDEs that deeply integrate AI into the workflow.
- Kiro‚Äôs ‚Äúless is more‚Äù philosophy shows that simplicity and performance can deliver a stronger developer experience than overly complex systems.
- I learned that successful AI adoption depends not only on technology but also on the design philosophy and integration approach used in tooling.
