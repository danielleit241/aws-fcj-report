# Report: ‚ÄúWORKSHOP: DATA SCIENCE ON AWS‚Äù

### Event Objectives

- Share AWS AI services
- Demonstrate deploying AI models using Amazon SageMaker
- Show how to deploy models and access them via APIs

### Speakers

- **Van Hoang Kha** - Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS User Group Leader
- **Bach Doan Vuong** - Cloud Developer Engineer, AWS Community Builder

### Highlights

#### **Introduction & the importance of Cloud in Data Science**

- Discussed the role of cloud computing in supporting data processing, training, and deploying AI models at scale.
- Cloud vs. On-premise:

  - Cloud: flexible scalability, rapid deployment, lower operating costs, easy integration.
  - On-premise: high upfront investment, harder to scale, complex maintenance.

- Cloud (especially **AWS**) provides a strong foundation for the Data Science pipeline ‚Äî from collection, storage, and processing to training and deploying AI models.

#### **AI Layers on AWS**

AWS organizes the AI ecosystem into **three layers**, helping users choose the right level of management based on skills and goals:

**1. AI Services (Fully Managed Layer)**

> _For users who want to apply AI without deep Machine Learning knowledge._

- Fully managed AI services that have been pre-trained by AWS.
- Users can call APIs to use them directly in applications.
- Examples:

  - **Amazon Comprehend:** Natural language processing (NLP)
  - **Amazon Translate:** Neural machine translation
  - **Amazon Textract:** Extract data from documents and invoices
  - **Amazon Rekognition:** Image and video recognition
  - **Amazon Polly:** Text-to-speech
  - **Amazon Bedrock:** Access to foundation models (e.g., Claude, Titan, Mistral)

üëâ Benefits: Fast deployment, no model training needed, cost scales with usage.

**2. ML Services (Semi-managed Layer)**

> _For Data Scientists and ML Engineers who want to build, train, and deploy ML models with more customization._

- **Amazon SageMaker** is at the center of this layer: it provides tools to build, train, and deploy ML models.
- Key features:

  - **Data Wrangler:** Visual data cleaning and processing.
  - **Feature Store:** Manage features across models.
  - **AutoML (SageMaker Autopilot):** Automated model training.
  - **Model Registry & Monitoring:** Track and manage models after deployment.

üëâ Benefits: Full control over the ML pipeline, customizable algorithms, training environments, and deployment workflows.

**3. AI Infrastructure (Self-managed Layer)**

> _For organizations or experts who want to fully manage AI/ML infrastructure to optimize cost or performance._

- Users can build training environments using core AWS infrastructure services:

  - **Amazon EC2 / GPU Instances (P5, G6, Inferentia):** Train large custom models.
  - **Amazon EKS / ECS:** Run ML workloads in containers or Kubernetes.
  - **AWS Lambda:** Small-scale data processing or serverless inference.
  - **Amazon S3 / EFS:** Store data and models.

üëâ Benefits: Maximum flexibility and control, but requires higher technical expertise.

#### Popular AWS AI Services to Support Students During Model Training

**1. Amazon SageMaker**

- Integrated development environment (SageMaker Studio) for the full ML lifecycle:

  - Data preparation
  - Model training
  - Result tracking
  - Deploying endpoints for API inference

- Supports AutoML, GPU training, model monitoring, and CI/CD for AI models.

**2. Amazon Comprehend**

- NLP service to analyze, understand, and classify natural language.

- Main capabilities:

  - Sentiment analysis
  - Entity recognition
  - Text classification
  - Automated labeling
  - Language detection

- Use cases:

  - Intelligent document processing
  - Bulk email analysis to detect positive/negative responses
  - Customer sentiment and behavioral analysis
  - Contact center analytics
  - Information extraction and validation

**3. Amazon Translate**

- Neural machine translation service.
- Supports over 75 languages with high accuracy and easy integration.
- Applications:

  - Multilingual websites
  - Automatic content translation in apps
  - Multilingual chatbot support and analytics

**4. Amazon Textract**

- Automatically extract text and structured data from images, documents, and forms.
- Used for processes like record digitization, invoice processing, and automatic data entry.

#### AWS Data Science Pipeline Overview

1. Data collection & storage: Amazon S3, AWS Data Exchange
2. Data preprocessing: AWS Glue, Lambda, Athena
3. Model training: SageMaker (train, tune, evaluate)
4. Model deployment: SageMaker Endpoint / Lambda + API Gateway
5. Monitoring & optimization: CloudWatch, Model Monitor

#### **Demo 1: Designing an AI Training Workflow with a Drag-and-Drop Interface (No-Code/Low-Code)**

- **Goal:** Show how to build an AI training pipeline without heavy coding.
- **Tools:** Amazon SageMaker Studio / SageMaker Canvas
- **Demo steps:**

  1. Prepare the dataset and upload it to Amazon S3.
  2. Use SageMaker's drag-and-drop interface to:

     - Choose data sources, training algorithms, and parameters.
     - Design a pipeline including data cleaning, training, validation, and deployment steps.

  3. Visually monitor training progress and model results (accuracy, confusion matrix, metrics, etc.).

- **Key message:** Students and developers can quickly create AI workflows without complex code, speeding up research and experimentation.

#### **Demo 2: Deploying an AI Service and Accessing It Via API/Website**

- **Goal:** Demonstrate how to deploy an AI model so users can access it in practice.
- **Tools:** Amazon SageMaker Endpoint, API Gateway, and Lambda.
- **Demo steps:**

  1. Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker Endpoint.
  2. Integrate the endpoint with API Gateway to create a public REST API.
  3. Provide a web route or API URL for users to send requests (e.g., submit text for sentiment analysis or translation).
  4. Show how to present results visually (UI demo or Postman/API test).

- **Key message:** Demonstrates how AWS supports moving AI from research to production ‚Äî easy to share, scale, and commercialize.

#### Discussion: Performance & Cost (Cloud vs. On-premise)
