### Purpose of the Event

- Learn about **security in GenAI and AI Agents** to strengthen enterprise safety.
- Explore the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** and how it applies to software development.
- Understand how to build a **unified data foundation** optimized for analytics and AI.
- Stay updated on the **latest GenAI strategies and trends** on AWS.

### Speakers

- **Jun Kai Loke** – AI/ML Specialist SA, AWS
- **Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Tamelly Lim** – Storage Specialist SA, AWS
- **Binh Tran** – Senior Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Taiki Dang** – Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Michael Armentano** – Principal WW GTM Specialist, AWS

### Key Highlights

## Main Content

1. **Unified Data Platform on AWS for AI & Analytics**

   - Building an end-to-end data pipeline: ingestion → storage → processing → access → governance.
   - Breaking down silos in data, people, and processes; enabling self-service & standardized governance.
   - Key services: S3, Glue, Redshift, Lake Formation, OpenSearch, Kinesis/MSK.

2. **GenAI Strategy on AWS**

   - Vision, trends, and enterprise adoption roadmap.
   - Amazon Bedrock: model selection, RAG, guardrails, cost/latency optimization.
   - AgentCore & Amazon Nova with support for frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex...).

3. **Securing GenAI Applications**

   - OWASP LLM risks; multilayered security: infrastructure → model → application.
   - Five pillars: Compliance, Privacy, Controls, Risk Management, Resilience.
   - Tools: Bedrock Guardrails, Human-in-the-loop, Observability (OpenTelemetry).

4. **AI Agents – Productivity Boosters**

   - From assistants to multi-agent systems, automation with less supervision.
   - Use cases: customer support, BI with Amazon Q (QuickSight), process automation.

5. **Reliability & Accuracy of GenAI**

   - Mitigating hallucination with Prompt Engineering, RAG, Fine-tuning.
   - RAG workflow: input → embedding → context → LLM → output.

6. **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)**

   - Lifecycle: Inception → Construction → Operation.
   - Evolution: AI-Assisted → AI-Driven → AI-Managed.
   - Implementation with IaC, automated testing, monitoring, and risk management.

7. **Amazon SageMaker – Unified Studio**
   - Unified environment for data, analytics, and AI.
   - Supports Lakehouse, governance, Zero-ETL integration (S3 ↔ Redshift, Aurora, DynamoDB, RDS...).
   - Full MLOps: pipelines, registry, deployment, monitoring.
   - Integrated with Bedrock & JumpStart to accelerate GenAI application development.

### Key Learnings

- **Design Mindset**

  - Build data & AI systems end-to-end, removing silos.
  - Apply self-service and governance principles from the start.

- **Technical Architecture**

  - Integrate AWS services (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker, Bedrock…) into a unified platform.
  - Apply Zero-ETL, Lakehouse, MLOps for scalability, governance, and sustainable operations.
  - Leverage AI Agents and GenAI frameworks to automate processes and boost productivity.

- **Strategy**

  - Define a GenAI adoption roadmap balancing innovation speed and cost.
  - Focus on multilayered security: infra, model, application; combine guardrails & human-in-the-loop.
  - Prioritize reliability and accuracy with RAG, prompt engineering, fine-tuning.

- **Software Development Mindset**
  - Transition from AI-Assisted → AI-Driven → AI-Managed.
  - Adopt AI-DLC to standardize development with AI involved at every stage.

### Application to Work

- **In projects**:

  - Experiment with AI Agents for registration/login and customer support.
  - Use validation/guardrails to safely integrate GenAI into applications.

- **In learning & team projects**:

  - Apply AI-DLC for task division: AI supports code/docs generation, team reviews & approves.
  - Know when to use Lambda (serverless) vs containers (ECS/Fargate).

- **As an intern**:
  - Learn to apply a business-first approach when writing documentation or gathering requirements.
  - Realize the importance of a solid data foundation for GenAI to deliver real value.
