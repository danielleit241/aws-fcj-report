Throughout my internship at the **AWS/First cloud journey program** from **08/08/2025** to **12/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply the knowledge equipped at school into a real-world working environment.
I participated **in learning AWS services, as well as applying learned knowledge into a group project with a FinTech theme**, thereby improving **teamwork skills, task allocation for team members, and especially achieving desired skills such as Docker, DevOps, and applying AWS services to support programming work**.

Regarding professional conduct, I always strive to complete tasks well, adhere to regulations, and actively exchange with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To reflect objectively on the internship process, I would like to self-assess based on the criteria below:

### Areas for Improvement

- Enhance discipline and strictly adhere to the regulations of the company or any organization.
- Train myself in persistence with specific tasks instead of drifting to other issues that cause distractions.
- Improve the mindset for problem-solving.
- Improve communication skills and the articulation of personal issues to Mentors as well as teammates.
- Need to research and learn more about new technologies, and learn to apply them rather than just learning for knowledge's sake.
- Support group members more in work as well as in learning.
