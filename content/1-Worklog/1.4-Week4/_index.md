### Week 4 Objectives:

- The goal of this week was to strengthen understanding of AWS data and AI services — from building scalable **DataLake architectures** to working with **serverless NoSQL databases (DynamoDB)** and exploring **AI development lifecycle management**.
- Additionally, this week aimed to enhance **technical translation** and **communication skills** through hands-on labs, blog translations, and participation in AWS events.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
