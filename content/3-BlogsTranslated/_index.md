### [Blog 1 - Accelerating generative AI development with fully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker AI](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces **fully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker AI**, which accelerates **Generative AI** development by unifying experiment tracking, behavior monitoring, and model lifecycle management into a single platform. This version adds **tracing and version tracking** features, enabling developers to capture inputs, outputs, and metadata for easier debugging and performance optimization. With deep integration into **Amazon Bedrock** and **SageMaker HyperPod**, MLflow 3.0 enhances observability, speeds up troubleshooting, and shortens the time to production for AI models.

### [Blog 2 - AI-Enhanced Subsurface Infrastructure Mapping on AWS](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog describes how **S2 Labs**, **Empact AI**, and **Kraken Robotics** use **physics-informed AI** on **AWS HPC** to enhance subsurface infrastructure mapping. This approach combines **magnetic imaging** and **deep learning** (using a **U-Net** model) to accurately reconstruct underground or underwater structures such as pipes and tanks. Leveraging **AWS Batch**, **EC2**, and **S3** for parallel computing, the system achieves high precision in detecting subsurface features up to 40 meters deep—significantly outperforming traditional mapping methods.

### [Blog 3 - Unlocking the full potential of Amazon Connect](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog explores how to unlock the full potential of **Amazon Connect**, an **AI- and AWS-powered contact center** platform. It highlights the importance of effective **change management**, including identifying the right **stakeholders**, securing an **executive sponsor**, building **change ambassadors**, and tracking **meaningful performance metrics**. Success relies on understanding business needs, targeted training, and strong internal communication. When properly implemented, **Amazon Connect** can enhance operations, enable automation, and deliver superior customer experiences—maximizing ROI and long-term value for organizations.
