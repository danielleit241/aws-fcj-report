This release turns managed MLflow from an experiment-tracking tool into an end-to-end observability solution, reducing time to market for Generative AI.\nAs customers across industries accelerate Generative AI development, they need experiment tracking, behavior observability, and performance evaluation for models and AI applications. Data scientists and developers often struggle to analyze model and application performance from experimentation to production, making root-cause analysis and remediation difficult. Teams spend significant time integrating tools instead of improving the quality of their models or generative AI applications.\nWith the launch of fully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can speed up Generative AI development by tracking experiments and observing model and application behavior with a single tool. MLflow 3.0’s tracing capabilities let customers record inputs, outputs, and metadata at every step of a Generative AI application, helping developers quickly identify the origin of errors or unexpected behavior. By keeping a history of each model and application version, MLflow 3.0 provides traceability, connecting AI feedback back to the underlying components. This lets developers trace issues back to the exact code, data, or parameters that caused them.\nCustomers using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod to train and deploy foundation models (FMs) can now use managed MLflow to track experiments, monitor training, gain deeper insights into model and application behavior, and manage the ML lifecycle at scale. This reduces troubleshooting time and allows teams to focus more on innovation.\nThis post introduces core concepts of fully managed MLflow 3.0 on SageMaker and provides technical guidance so you can leverage the new features to accelerate your next Generative AI application.\nGet started You can get started with fully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker to track experiments, manage models, and optimize the Generative AI/ML lifecycle via the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the API.\nPrerequisites To get started you need:\nAn AWS account with billing enabled\nAn Amazon SageMaker Studio AI domain (see the guide: Guide to getting set up with Amazon SageMaker AI)\nConfigure your environment to use the SageMaker-managed MLflow tracking server Configuration steps: In the SageMaker Studio UI, open the Applications panel, choose MLflow, then select Create. Enter a unique name for the tracking server and specify the Amazon S3 URI where experiment artifacts will be stored. Choose Create. (SageMaker defaults to MLflow v3.0.)\nOptional: choose Update to adjust settings such as server size, tags, and IAM role.\nThe server is provisioned and started automatically and typically takes about 25 minutes. After setup completes, you can launch the MLflow UI from SageMaker Studio to begin tracking ML and Generative AI experiments. For more details on tracking server configuration, see Machine learning experiments using Amazon SageMaker AI with MLflow in the SageMaker Developer Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/mlflow.html\nTo start logging experiments to the SageMaker managed MLflow tracking server you created, install both MLflow and the SageMaker MLflow Python package in your environment. You can use SageMaker Studio managed Jupyter Lab, SageMaker Studio Code Editor, a local IDE, or any environment that supports AI workloads to connect to the SageMaker managed MLflow tracking server.\nTo install both Python packages with pip: pip install mlflow==3.0 sagemaker-mlflow==0.1.0\nTo connect and start logging your AI experiments, parameters, and models directly to the managed MLflow on SageMaker, replace the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your SageMaker MLflow tracking server:\nimport mlflow # SageMaker MLflow ARN tracking_server_arn = \u0026#34;arn:aws:sagemaker:\u0026lt;Region\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;Account_id\u0026gt;:mlflow-tracking-server/\u0026lt;Name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; # Enter ARN mlflow.set_tracking_uri(tracking_server_arn) mlflow.set_experiment(\u0026#34;customer_support_genai_app\u0026#34;) Your environment is now configured and ready to track experiments with the SageMaker managed MLflow tracking server.\nImplement tracing and version tracking for Generative AI applications Generative AI applications have many components — code, configuration, and data — which can become hard to manage without systematic versioning. A LoggedModel entity in managed MLflow 3.0 represents your AI model, agent, or Generative AI application within an experiment. It provides unified tracking of model artifacts, execution traces, evaluation metrics, and metadata across the development lifecycle. A trace is a recorded log of inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps from a single application execution. Traces offer deep visibility into application performance, execution flow, and response quality, aiding debugging and evaluation. With LoggedModel, you can track and compare different versions of an application, making it easy to identify issues, deploy the best version, and maintain a clear record of what was deployed and when.\nTo implement version tracking and tracing with managed MLflow 3.0 on SageMaker, you can establish a model identity with a version using the Git commit hash, set it as the active model context so subsequent traces automatically link to that specific version, enable automatic logging for interactions with Amazon Bedrock, and then make an API call to Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet — that call will be fully traced, with inputs, outputs, and metadata automatically recorded in the established model context. Managed MLflow 3.0 tracing integrates with a number of Generative AI libraries and provides one-line automatic tracing for all supported libraries. For details on supported libraries, see Supported Integrations in the MLflow documentation.\n# 1. Define your application version using the git commit logged_model= \u0026#34;customer_support_agent\u0026#34; logged_model_name = f\u0026#34;{logged_model}-{git_commit}\u0026#34; # 2.Set the active model context - traces will be linked to this mlflow.set_active_model(name=logged_model_name) # 3.Set auto logging for your model provider mlflow.bedrock.autolog() # 4. Chat with your LLM provider # Ensure that your boto3 client has the necessary auth information bedrock = boto3.client( service_name=\u0026#34;bedrock-runtime\u0026#34;, region_name=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AWS_REGION\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, ) model = \u0026#34;anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0\u0026#34; messages = [{ \u0026#34;role\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;}]}] # All intermediate executions within the chat session will be logged bedrock.converse(modelId=model, messages=messages) After recording this information you can view Generative AI experiments and the LoggedModel for the agent in the Managed MLflow 3.0 tracking server UI, as shown in the screenshot below.\nIn addition to one-line auto tracing, MLflow provides a Python SDK so you can manually instrument your code and work with traces. See the sample notebook sagemaker_mlflow_strands.ipynb in the aws-samples GitHub repository, where we use MLflow manual instrumentation to trace Strands Agents. With tracing in fully managed MLflow 3.0 you can capture inputs, outputs, and metadata for each intermediate step of a request to help identify the root cause of errors and unexpected behavior.\nThese capabilities provide observability for your AI workloads by collecting detailed information about the execution of workload services, nodes, and tools, and you can inspect them under the Traces tab.\nYou can inspect an individual trace, as illustrated below, by selecting the request ID for the trace you want to view in the Traces tab.\nFully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker also introduces tagging for traces. Tags are mutable key–value pairs you can attach to traces to add metadata and contextual information. Trace tags make it easy to organize, search, and filter traces by criteria such as user session, environment, model version, or performance characteristics. You can add, update, or remove tags at any time — while a trace is executing using mlflow.update_current_trace() or after a trace has been logged using the MLflow APIs or UI.\nManaged MLflow 3.0 makes searching and analyzing traces seamless, helping teams quickly identify issues, compare agent behavior, and optimize performance. Both the tracing UI and the Python API support powerful filtering, so you can dive into traces based on attributes such as status, tags, user, environment, or execution time, as shown in the screenshot below.\nFor example, you can immediately find all traces with errors, filter by production environment, or find traces for a specific request. This capability is important for debugging, cost analysis, and continuous improvement of Generative AI applications.\nThe screenshot below shows the traces returned when searching for the tag \u0026lsquo;Production\u0026rsquo;.\nThe following code shows how you can search for all traces in the production environment with a successful status:\n# Search for traces in production environment with successful status\ntraces = mlflow.search_traces(filter_string=\u0026ldquo;attributes.status = \u0026lsquo;OK\u0026rsquo; AND tags.environment = \u0026lsquo;production\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;)\nUsing MLflow tracing for Generative AI Building and deploying generative AI agents — such as chat-based assistants, code generators, or customer support assistants — requires deep observability into how those agents interact with large language models (LLMs) and external tools. In a typical agentic workflow, the agent iterates through reasoning steps, calls LLMs, and uses tools or subsystems like search APIs or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers until the user task is completed. These complex, multi-step interactions make debugging, optimization, and cost tracking particularly challenging.\nTraditional observability tools fall short for generative AI because agent decisions, tool calls, and LLM responses are dynamic and context-dependent. Managed MLflow 3.0 tracing provides comprehensive observability by recording every LLM call, tool invocation, and decision point in the agent workflow. You can use this end-to-end trace data to:\nDebug agent behavior — pinpoint where an agent’s reasoning went off track or why it produced an unexpected output.\nMonitor tool usage — discover when and how external tools are invoked and analyze their impact on quality and cost.\nTrack performance and cost — measure latency, token usage, and API cost at each step of the agentic loop.\nAudit and govern — maintain detailed logs for compliance and analysis.\nImagine a practical scenario using the managed MLflow 3.0 tracing UI for a sample finance customer support agent equipped with a tool for retrieving financial data from a datastore. While developing a generative AI customer support agent or analyzing agent behavior in production, you can observe whether the agent’s response and execution invoke the product database tool to provide more accurate recommendations.\nExample: the first trace (shown below) captures the agent handling a user query without calling any tools. The trace records the prompt, agent response, and decision points. The agent’s response lacks product-specific detail. The trace clearly shows that no external tool was invoked, which helps you quickly identify this behavior in the agent’s reasoning chain.\nThe second trace (shown below) records the same agent but this time the agent decides to call the product database tool. This trace logs the tool invocation, the returned product data, and how the agent integrates that information into the final response. Here, you can observe improved answer quality, slightly increased latency, and additional API cost due to higher token usage.\nBy comparing these traces side-by-side you can debug why the agent sometimes skips using the tool, optimize when and how tools are called, and balance quality with latency and cost. MLflow’s Tracing UI makes agentic loops transparent, actionable, and straightforward to analyze at scale. The sample agent used in this post and the full source code are available in the aws-samples GitHub repository so you can reproduce and adapt it for your own applications.\nClean up resources After creation, a SageMaker managed MLflow tracking server incurs charges until you stop or delete it. Tracking server charges are based on server uptime, selected size, and the amount of data logged to the tracking server. You can stop the tracking server when not in use to save costs, or delete it via the API or the SageMaker Studio UI. For pricing details, see Amazon SageMaker pricing.\nConclusion Fully managed MLflow 3.0 on Amazon SageMaker AI is now available. Get started with the sample code in the aws-samples GitHub repository.

This technology is critical for urban planning, utility maintenance, oil \u0026amp; gas operations, construction safety, and environmental protection. Without accurate subsurface maps, construction projects risk costly delays, dangerous utility strikes, and environmental damage. For example, when Hurricane Ivan damaged an offshore oil platform in 2004, important infrastructure was buried under 35–45 meters of sediment, creating an invisible hazard that traditional mapping techniques could not fully detect.\nThrough a collaboration between S2 Labs, Empact AI, and Kraken Robotics, a breakthrough in subsurface infrastructure mapping has emerged on AWS. The approach combines advanced magnetic imaging with physics-informed AI to deliver unprecedentedly clear images of subsurface structures — especially in scenarios where traditional methods fail. The combination of cloud computing and AI is changing how the industry visualizes and understands critical buried infrastructure.\nDetection methods and limitations Traditional subsurface imaging uses a range of geophysical techniques, each suited to specific materials and conditions. For example, electromagnetic methods detect metallic pipes and cables via conductivity, while magnetometers measure variations in Earth’s magnetic field to identify ferrous materials such as steel pipes. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is particularly effective at imaging concrete structures and geological layers; specialized frequencies can reveal plastic pipes or water-bearing assets because of dielectric contrasts.\nManual interpretation of survey data typically involves 2D signal analysis and basic depth estimation — a fast but approximate approach. Two main challenges arise: first, different subsurface configurations can produce nearly identical sensor responses, making it ambiguous which configuration is correct without additional data. Second, real-world environments contain heterogeneous soils, moisture levels, and material densities that vary over short distances, producing complex signals that traditional algorithms struggle to interpret accurately.\nExamining a magnetic survey result, surface measurements show magnetic intensity variations across a 50 m area as illustrated in Figure 1(a). When processed with conventional methods, we obtain a blurred image suggesting a pipe-like structure down to about 5 m, but the result lacks detail (Figure 1(b)). This is where an AI-based approach shows its strength — producing a much sharper image that reveals a pipe-like structure at 1–1.5 m depth (Figure 1(c)). The AI-based result is far more precise while remaining consistent with the original magnetic measurements.\nFigure 1. (a) Map view over a 50 m survey patch. (b) Conventional small-square inversion. (c) Deep-learning-based inversion.\nPhysics-informed deep learning solution S2 Labs applies physics-informed AI and AWS high performance computing (HPC) to solve hard engineering problems across oil \u0026amp; gas, manufacturing, healthcare, and biotech — delivering scientifically accurate results with reduced compute time. S2 Labs partnered with two domain specialists: Empact AI, which provides 3D subsurface pipe mapping, and Kraken Robotics, which contributes high-resolution underwater imagery via Synthetic Aperture Sonar. This collaboration integrates advanced sonar, 3D subsurface analysis, and AI-driven pattern recognition on AWS Cloud to locate and characterize pipeline leaks with higher accuracy and speed.\nOur AI approach combines the physics of magnetic fields with deep learning to better interpret what lies underground. By training AI on simulated data that models real-world structures like tanks and pipes, we teach it to “read” magnetic measurements like a map. Using a specialized neural network architecture called U-Net, the model learns to translate magnetic signals into crisp images of subsurface structures, identifying not only location but also composition and shape. For technical details, see the recent research paper published by S2 Labs.\nModel training The physics-informed deep learning model was trained on AWS by combining high performance compute, scalable data storage, and parallel processing services, as illustrated in the architecture diagram in Figure 2.\nUsing Amazon EC2 instances, we generated 202,000 3D susceptibility models (each with 226,000 cells) representing many different subsurface scenarios — including pipes at multiple orientations, multiple-pipe configurations, and tanks.\nThe models were parameterized by domain knowledge and stored as NumPy files in Amazon S3 buckets. S2 Labs’ proprietary magnetostatic solver was containerized and stored in Amazon ECR for consistent deployment across compute resources. The solver processed models sequentially from S3 and wrote the response data back to S3.\nWe also employed distributed computing using AWS Batch to generate synthetic data, utilizing Spot Instances to optimize cost. We used P4d instances, each providing eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs, to compute field responses at 1,800 measurement points spaced 2 meters apart. The pipeline synchronized data between Amazon S3 and local storage, trained a 2D U-Net architecture (500M parameters) for 110 epochs, achieving training loss 0.0018 and validation loss 0.0019. The full computation required 100,000 CPU hours.\nFigure 2. Architecture diagram for synthetic data generation and model training on AWS.\nScalable inference workflow for large magnetic surveys Our magnetic survey pipeline applies a systematic four-stage workflow to process large surveys efficiently while preserving high-quality, reproducible reconstructions of subsurface infrastructure, illustrated in Figure 3.\nStage 1 — Data Acquisition: Field data collection uses magnetometer systems customized to the survey environment — drone-mounted for airborne surveys, ground systems for land surveys, or underwater systems for marine applications. Surveys follow a systematic grid sampling pattern with consistent sensor heights and transect spacing to ensure uniform coverage of the target area.\nStage 2 — Survey Domain Preparation: Rather than processing the entire survey area at once, we adopt a modular approach by dividing the survey domain into smaller tiles sized to the AI training input. Adjacent tiles include overlap regions that are critical to ensuring smooth transitions in the final reconstruction and avoiding edge artifacts.\nStage 3 — Parallel Processing Architecture: The workflow leverages parallel computing to process many tiles simultaneously, dramatically reducing compute time while preserving consistency with the trained model parameters. This distributed approach efficiently uses compute resources by processing tiles independently. For example, our deployment can process a survey volume of 400 m x 400 m x 60 m in under 5 seconds.\nStage 4 — AI-Based Inference: The trained AI model performs inference on each tile independently, reconstructing subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from field magnetic measurements. The reconstructions are then blended smoothly using weighted blending across overlap regions to ensure seamless transitions between neighboring tiles. This modular pipeline enables scalable surveying at any size while maintaining consistent resolution and optimizing memory usage via effective parallel processing, making it practical for real-world applications from infrastructure mapping to geological surveys.\nFigure 3. Modular processing workflow for large-scale magnetic surveys.\nCase study: mapping buried offshore well conductors in the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Ivan (2004) damaged an offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, burying well conductors under 35–45 meters of sediment. Initial acoustic imaging in 2022 had some success but remained limited where gas-bearing sediments obscured critical areas. A high-resolution magnetometer array was deployed 3.5 m above the seafloor to detect iron-rich conductors through hydrocarbon-saturated sediment.\nThe model described earlier successfully mapped conductors buried at 35–45 m depths, revealing a primary conductor bundle and a secondary fragment 40 m northeast of the well bay (see Figure 4). The results show strong discrimination of magnetic signatures even in complex debris fields, verified where possible with borehole locations and acoustic imagery. This demonstrates the power of deep learning in cases where traditional acoustic methods fail.\nFigure 4. Plan view (a) and oblique view (b) of relative susceptibility distribution.\nConclusion Our work demonstrates how AI-enhanced magnetic imaging is transforming subsurface infrastructure mapping across industries — from onshore utilities to deep offshore well conductors. Physics-informed deep learning trained on AWS combines HPC resources, scalable storage, and parallel processing services to overcome limitations of traditional magnetic data interpretation.\nThrough real-world case studies, we demonstrated that deep learning can exceed traditional magnetic interpretation limits and map structures successfully at 40 m depth beneath the seafloor — structures that remained “invisible” to acoustic methods for 18 years.\nThe impact of this technology spans oil \u0026amp; gas decommissioning, urban utility mapping, environmental protection, and marine operations. While results are promising, opportunities remain in multi-physics integration, real-time processing, and higher-resolution imaging.\nTo collaborate or learn more about deployment, please contact us at santi@s2labs.co or ryanqi@amazon.com.\nAuthors Santi Adavani Dr. Santi Adavani is the founder and CEO of S2 Labs, a deep-tech startup building AI products to accelerate scientific discovery.

Every business is racing to adopt the latest technology innovations that can improve service, reduce costs, and support strategic growth. Amazon Connect is one of those solutions—powered by AWS and AI, it’s a modern, scalable contact-center platform. However, cutting corners during implementation can undermine the benefits.\nHere we look at how change-management best practices can not only protect but accelerate your investment—risks to watch for, which metrics really matter, and how to maximize limited time and resources to deliver high-impact change.\nDon’t \u0026ldquo;Trip Up\u0026rdquo; on Stakeholders \u0026ldquo;Stakeholders\u0026rdquo; are often misunderstood. Many organizations focus too much on either internal or external groups. For a customer-service technology and process transformation, it’s critical to focus on external stakeholders because they have direct impact.\nExternal stakeholders include customers, partners, and vendors—the people who contact your service center. Their ability to receive information, resolve issues, and feel heard matters greatly to program success and whether they’ll remain engaged with you long term.\nInternally, large programs require cross-organizational coordination. An executive sponsor can marshal resources and help ensure success. Beyond IT, operations and marketing, you’ll need finance, HR, and other teams involved. Not all stakeholders are equal—the level of engagement and oversight depends on role and influence.\nUnderstand What You Actually Need Amazon Connect is a powerful, customizable platform serving many use cases—from omnichannel contact, interaction automation, agent assist with generative AI, dynamic reporting, automated quality evaluation, and more.\nBut without a clear understanding of current processes, pain points, and business requirements, you risk scope drift and losing benefits. Do you need an intelligent IVR to reduce call volume and shorten transfers to agents? Do you need Connect integrated with a legacy CRM? Are SLAs slipping because of sudden call spikes or scheduling issues?\nIdentify these factors early and a deployment roadmap will emerge, backed by a clear business case. You’ll have a compelling story with metrics to prove ROI and clear goals for the teams. This is also a strength of AWS Partner CloudInteract—using AI to uncover insights and bring precision to improvement planning.\nEnsure Executive Sponsorship A committed executive sponsor plays a vital role in driving momentum and raising organizational awareness for any transformation program. They need a convincing vision and by actively promoting the project they can help surface and address potential risks.\nThis approach helps remove blockers early while fostering a collaborative environment where stakeholders feel encouraged to contribute. Executive presence and support also build trust and credibility—essential elements for a successful rollout.\nBuild Change Ambassadors The biggest mistake in technology transformation is assuming you don’t need to \u0026ldquo;tell the story\u0026rdquo; about the change—that a few technical benefit emails and a single training session are enough.\nYou need to run an internal communications campaign for the change. Investing in two-way channels (monitored email, lunch-and-learns, community forums, Q\u0026amp;A sessions after town halls) will both build goodwill and surface practitioner insights.\nExtend influence by recruiting and supporting champions—people who can spread the change. They’re often early adopters and testers. You can incentivize participation by including these activities in annual goals, which helps expand impact across affected groups.\nTrain More Effectively with Fewer Resources As the program progresses, different groups will require different training. Initially, IT needs to learn the new environment and how to configure and manage it. Next, operations must train agents and supervisors for day-to-day use. Everything starts with a change impact assessment.\nThis assessment identifies which groups are most and most critically affected. If resources are limited and you can’t train everyone directly, focus on the business-breakers—the groups that are mission-critical. For other groups, substitute remote or self-paced learning.\nMeasure What Actually Matters Don’t let metrics become slogans. Does reporting email-open rates actually show that employees understand the change? An opened email doesn’t equal awareness. A better measure might be the number of manager-led meetings run using the toolkit you provided.\nThe mistake is measuring only project metrics. You need to demonstrate long-term improvement: reduced transfer rates, handle-time reductions, CSAT, or time comparisons for manual tasks before (scheduling, performance review, or reporting).\nProject-status reporting is important but temporary—the metrics that really matter are those from the business case. Start tracking them as early as possible, especially in phased rollouts, to quickly surface gaps in training and adoption.\nIn Summary A few key factors make Amazon Connect implementations more effective and unlock full value. Plan ahead, bring the organization along, deploy carefully, and this AI-enabled contact-center solution will exceed expectations—from omnichannel and agent experience to automation and analytics.\nContact AWS and CloudInteract for additional help unlocking the full power of Amazon Connect:\nAWS: https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-field-SP-Amazon-Connect-Contact-Us-reg.html CloudInteract: https://resources.cloudinteract.io/apollo-making-every-contact-count (Loose translation: \u0026ldquo;unlock the superpowers of Amazon Connect\u0026rdquo;)\n"},{"uri":"https://danielleit241.github.io/aws-fcj-report/4-eventparticipated/4.1-event1/","title":"Event 1","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Report on “Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders (Track 1: GenAI \u0026amp; Data)” Purpose of the Event Learn about security in GenAI and AI Agents to strengthen enterprise safety.

Embrace the philosophy of AI augmenting humans rather than replacing them in the software development process. Observe how tools like Amazon Q and other AI assistants support developers from ideation and code generation to infrastructure deployment (IaC). Learn about the emerging trend of “AI-first development,” where AI becomes a natural part of future dev workflows. Speakers Toan Huynh My Nguyen Highlights Challenges of programming with AI The introduction covered the limitations and challenges of applying AI to programming:\nAI still struggles with projects that require deep domain knowledge and complex business logic. Developers can have limited control over generated code when prompts and scope are not well-defined. The quality of generated code depends heavily on the prompt and context provided to the model. This motivates the AI-DLC approach: creating a structured process to help AI and humans collaborate more effectively.\nHow AI is changing software development This section analyzed how AI is transforming the software industry:\nAI assists code generation, technical documentation, API design, and automated testing. Developers shift roles from “code writers” to “AI orchestrators” who guide, evaluate, and refine AI outputs. Tools like Amazon Q, GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for Developers become central parts of modern development workflows. 🔹 What is AI-DLC AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) is an AI-augmented software development approach where each stage is designed to provide AI with specific context and goals to produce more accurate results.\n🟧 Inception\nBuild Context on Existing Code – feed AI the current codebase so it understands project structure. Elaborate Intent with User Stories – developers describe requirements via user stories to clarify goals. Plan with Units of Work – break work into small units the AI can execute and generate code for. 🟦 Construction\nDomain Model (Component Model) – build domain models or architecture diagrams. Generate Code \u0026amp; Test – AI generates code and tests based on the plan. Add Architectural Components – add API layers, data layers, logging, and security components. Deploy with IaC \u0026amp; Tests – automate deployment using Infrastructure as Code and integration tests. 🔁 Each stage provides richer context for the next, helping AI produce increasingly accurate outputs.\nCore Concepts Context Awareness – AI needs clear context about code, requirements, and domain to work well. Collaborative Generation – humans and AI collaborate: AI generates code, humans direct and verify outputs. Continuous Refinement – iterative cycles to refine outputs and improve quality. Mob Elaboration Mob Elaboration is a collaborative method for elaborating intents:\nMultiple participants contribute user stories, questions, and additional context for the AI. It helps AI gain deeper understanding of domain, goals, and complex logic. This approach reduces the risk of misunderstandings—especially in large or cross-domain teams. The 5-Stage Sequential Process of AI-DLC AI-DLC runs through 5 phases:\nInception – understand requirements and analyze the system. Construction – create domain models and initial structure. Generation – automated code generation. Testing – automated unit and integration testing. Deployment – deploy applications with IaC and CI/CD pipelines. Each loop improves the AI\u0026rsquo;s outputs through incremental learning and feedback.\nDemo 1 – Interactive AI-DLC experience with Amazon Q The demo showcased AI-DLC in practice with a small project:\nStart from a simple idea and turn it into a user story describing business requirements. AI helps split tasks into Units of Work and plans implementation details for each module. Attendees interact with AI using questions, checkboxes, and logical conditions to clarify scope. AI generates code, tests, project structure, and executes trial deployments. The demo illustrated smooth collaboration between AI and humans: AI performs repetitive generation while humans steer and make decisions. Introducing Kiro Philosophy of Kiro\nThe workshop introduced Kiro, an intelligent development environment built around the idea of “AI-native development” where AI is a core collaborator rather than just a tool.\nKiro’s philosophy emphasizes three points:\nDeep integration with the development process – AI participates in planning, context management, and impact analysis. Comprehensive project context – Kiro maintains ongoing awareness of project structure so AI can interact with the whole project rather than single files. Intelligent control \u0026amp; collaboration – developers guide AI via contextual commands so each change has clear intent and consistency. This makes Kiro more than a code generator: it is an ecosystem for collaborative human–AI development.\nProject structure in Kiro\nUnlike traditional text editors like VSCode or JetBrains, Kiro is an AI-aware workspace with structural awareness.\nIts project model includes:\nContext Layer – stores context, domain models, and relationships among modules. Task Layer – manages Units of Work tracked and executed by AI. AI Agent Layer – agents handle specific tasks (code, tests, refactor, deploy) enabling a multi-agent collaborative model. Human-in-the-Loop Control – developers can confirm, modify, or reject AI outputs at any stage. Kiro therefore becomes an ecosystem for coordinated human–AI development rather than just a code editor.\nDemo 2: Kiro in practice In the demonstration, the presenters showed how Kiro implements AI-DLC:\nUser provides a basic business requirement like “build an event management system.” Kiro analyzes intent, creates a domain model, and splits work into user stories. AI generates modules, components, and corresponding test cases. Developers interact with a checkbox-based task control to approve each unit of work. Kiro finally deploys the completed system using IaC and automated tests. The demo proved AI-DLC is practical: AI, human operators, and processes integrate into a single coherent workflow.\nEvent experience Attending the workshop “AI DLC x Kiro: Reinventing Developer Experience with AI” was highly valuable, clarifying how AI can be deeply embedded into the developer experience and how Kiro’s design offers a fresh approach for developers.\nInsights from expert speakers Speakers presented AI-DLC as a platform that automates many SDLC tasks and supports software development using AI. The Kiro introduction gave a perspective on designing an AI-native text editor rather than adding AI plugins to legacy editors. I was particularly impressed by Kiro’s philosophy: minimalism, high performance, user-focused experience, and modular extensibility. Practical technical takeaways The demo showed how AI-DLC and Kiro can create, refactor, and optimize code efficiently. A small starter project was created and managed within Kiro, demonstrating auto-refactoring, test generation and logic analysis. Compared to editors like VSCode and Sublime, Kiro stands out for its AI-first architecture and lightweight plugin model that preserves performance. Modern tooling and potential applications Experiencing AI-DLC on Kiro highlighted the potential to automate development workflows—especially code generation, documentation, and debugging. I saw opportunities to build personal learning and productivity tools that provide smart suggestions and accelerate development. Kiro’s modular design inspires approaches to building flexible, maintainable systems. Networking and discussions The workshop offered chances to connect with developers, AI researchers, and product designers, deepening my understanding of AI-augmented development. Discussions helped me see AI as a creative collaborator, allowing developers to focus more on system logic and architecture. Key lessons AI-DLC combined with Kiro is a model for next-generation development tools—AI-first IDEs that deeply integrate AI into the workflow. Kiro’s “less is more” philosophy shows that simplicity and performance can deliver a stronger developer experience than overly complex systems. I learned that successful AI adoption depends not only on technology but also on the design philosophy and integration approach used in tooling.

Event Experience \u0026amp; Reflection Participating in this workshop expanded my perspective from basic concepts to the cutting-edge technologies shaping the future of AI.\n1. The Shift from \u0026ldquo;Q\u0026amp;A\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Action\u0026rdquo; (Agentic AI) The most impressive concept for me was Agentic AI. Previously, I viewed AI primarily for chatting or summarization. However, through the AgentCore presentation, I see a future of \u0026ldquo;virtual employees\u0026rdquo; capable of planning, using tools (like web browsers or code interpreters), and solving complex workflows without constant human hand-holding.\n2. Solving the \u0026ldquo;Production\u0026rdquo; Puzzle I resonated deeply with the discussion on the \u0026ldquo;Chasm\u0026rdquo; between POC and Production. Tools like Amazon Bedrock AgentCore are essentially the key to building enterprise trust. They provide the necessary security layers (Identity) and control mechanisms (Observability) that allow businesses to confidently delegate tasks to AI.\n3.

Modernize Infrastructure (IaC): Shift from manual operations (ClickOps) to managing infrastructure as code using CloudFormation, Terraform, and CDK. Optimize Applications (Containerization): Master the architecture and strategy for selecting the appropriate container platform: App Runner, ECS, or EKS. Comprehensive Monitoring (Observability): Build proactive monitoring systems to detect errors and optimize performance using CloudWatch and X-Ray. Speakers AWS Experts \u0026amp; Cloud Engineers: Shared insights on system architecture, Platform Engineering strategies, and deep-dive technical demos. Key Content Details 1. DevOps Mindset \u0026amp; CI/CD Pipeline (The Foundation) The event began by redefining DevOps not just as a set of tools, but as a culture of optimizing the value stream.\nThe Value Cycle:\nA closed-loop 5-step process: Insights \u0026amp; Analysis -\u0026gt; Portfolio \u0026amp; Backlog -\u0026gt; Continuous Integration -\u0026gt; Continuous Testing -\u0026gt; Continuous Delivery. Core Goal: Increase delivery speed (Speed) to meet market demands faster, while ensuring system stability (Stability) and quality. Redefining CI/CD Concepts:\nContinuous Integration (CI): Developers merge code frequently (daily). The system automatically builds and runs Unit Tests. The goal is to detect errors early (Fail fast). Continuous Delivery: Automates the deployment process to Staging/Pre-prod environments. Deployment to Production requires human approval (Manual Trigger). Continuous Deployment: Fully automated 100% from Code Commit to running in Production (no manual intervention). Effective Pipeline Strategy:\nCentralized CI: Build a centralized CI system for security and resource management, but ensure Self-service capabilities for Developers to avoid bottlenecks. Artifact Management: Apply the \u0026ldquo;Build Once, Deploy Anywhere\u0026rdquo; principle. Source code is built only once into a Binary package (Artifact). Subsequent environments (Staging, Prod) use this exact Artifact for deployment, ensuring absolute consistency. Fail Fast Conditions: The pipeline must be configured to fail immediately if violations occur: Compilation errors, Code Style violations, Security scans finding vulnerabilities, or Tests running too slow. Measuring Efficiency (Metrics):\nUse Heatmaps to monitor the Pipeline health of the entire organization. Golden Metrics: Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery). 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - From ClickOps to Code This section delved into eliminating manual habits (ClickOps) and moving towards full infrastructure automation.\nThe Problem with \u0026ldquo;ClickOps\u0026rdquo;: Manual operations on the AWS Console are prone to Human Error, slow, hard to scale, and cause inconsistency between Dev/Prod environments. IaC Solutions: Provide Automation, Scalability, Reproducibility, and Collaboration. Deep Dive into Top 3 IaC Tools:\n1. AWS CloudFormation (Native Tool):\nUses text files (YAML or JSON) to describe the desired state. Template Anatomy: Structure includes Parameters (Dynamic inputs), Mappings (Handling regional differences - e.g., different AMI IDs per Region), and Resources (The actual assets to create). Stack: The unit for managing resource lifecycles. Deleting a Stack deletes all associated resources. 2. Terraform (Multi-Cloud Powerhouse):\nOpen-source tool, uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Strength: Multi-platform support (Multi-cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP\u0026hellip;). Workflow: Write (Code) -\u0026gt; Plan (Preview changes) -\u0026gt; Apply (Execute). The Plan step is critical for safety checks. State File: Stores the actual state of the infrastructure for synchronization. 3. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit):\nAllows defining infrastructure using programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Java\u0026hellip;). Constructs: L1 (Cfn Resources): Detailed configuration for every line (like CloudFormation). L2 (Curated): Automatically applies Best Practices and secure default configurations. L3 (Patterns): Builds complex architectures (e.g., VPC + ALB + ECS) in just a few lines of code. Drift Detection: A crucial feature to detect discrepancies between Code and Reality (caused by manual \u0026ldquo;ClickOps\u0026rdquo; changes), helping maintain operational discipline.\n3. Containerization - Application Strategy Deep analysis of container orchestration platforms:\nKubernetes (K8s):\nArchitecture includes Control Plane (API Server, etcd, Scheduler) and Worker Nodes (Kubelet, Pods). Powerful and flexible but complex to operate. Comparison: Amazon ECS vs. Amazon EKS:\nAmazon ECS: Simple, deeply integrated with AWS (ALB, IAM). Suitable for teams wanting to reduce operational overhead and deploy fast. Amazon EKS: Based on standard Kubernetes. Powerful, massive ecosystem. Suitable for Enterprises, complex systems, or Hybrid-cloud. Compute Options:\nEC2 Launch Type: You manage the servers (Patching, Scaling). Highest control but high operational effort. AWS Fargate (Serverless): No server management required. AWS handles the infrastructure; users only define CPU/RAM for Tasks. Secure and convenient. AWS App Runner:\n\u0026ldquo;Zero-ops\u0026rdquo; solution for Web Apps/APIs. Fully automated from Source Code/Image -\u0026gt; Public URL (HTTPS) without configuring networking or servers. 4. Observability - Monitoring \u0026amp; Optimization Closing the development lifecycle loop with deep observability to ensure stable system operation.\nAmazon CloudWatch (System Eyes \u0026amp; Ears):\nMetrics: Collect performance data (CPU, Memory, Disk). Logs: Centralized application log collection. Use Logs Insights to query errors. Alarms: Automatically trigger actions (Auto Scaling, Restart Server, Send Notifications) when thresholds are breached. AWS X-Ray (Distributed Tracing):\nSolves the \u0026ldquo;needle in a haystack\u0026rdquo; problem in Microservices. Distributed Tracing: Tracks the journey of a request across multiple services to identify bottlenecks and root causes. AWS Observability Best Practices:\nUtilize AWS resources to reference standard Patterns and Recipes. Clear distinction: Logs (Discrete events) vs. Traces (Connected journeys). Event Experience \u0026amp; Reflection Participating in this series brought significant changes to my perception and technical skills:\n1. The Shift from \u0026ldquo;Ops\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Platform Engineering\u0026rdquo; I realized the role of modern DevOps is not running after Developers to manually deploy code. DevOps is about architecting a \u0026ldquo;Highway\u0026rdquo; (Pipeline \u0026amp; Platform). A good platform allows Developers to Self-service environment creation and code deployment quickly, while staying within the safety boundaries (Governance) established by the DevOps team.\n2. Operational Discipline Lessons on Artifact Management and Drift Detection are golden rules. In an Enterprise environment, consistency is vital. Differences in build processes across environments (Dev/Test/Prod) are strictly prohibited, and manual changes to code-managed systems must be forbidden.\n3. Smart Tool Selection Strategy There is no \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; tool, only the \u0026ldquo;most suitable\u0026rdquo; one:\nNeed absolute stability and deepest support for new AWS services: Choose CloudFormation. Enterprise using Multi-cloud or Hybrid-cloud: Terraform is the optimal choice. Strong Programming Development Team needing to build complex architectures fast with high code reuse: AWS CDK is the strongest weapon. Simple Web Applications: Use App Runner instead of wasting resources operating a Kubernetes cluster. Conclusion The \u0026ldquo;DevOps \u0026amp; IaC Mastery\u0026rdquo; series provided a complete roadmap for the Cloud journey:\nMindset: Transitioning from manual work to automation and data-driven measurement. Infrastructure: Mastering IaC for scalable, reproducible systems with drift control. Operations: Combining flexible Containerization and deep Observability to ensure system stability, high performance, and self-healing capabilities. This is a solid knowledge foundation for building large-scale, modern software systems on AWS.\nSome photos from the event "},{"uri":"https://danielleit241.github.io/aws-fcj-report/4-eventparticipated/4.6-event6/","title":"Event 6","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3” Event Purpose This series was not just about individual services but a journey in System Thinking, helping to transition from traditional infrastructure management to a Cloud-Native Security model.

Credential Spectrum: Absolute shift from Long-term Credentials (Permanent Access Keys - high risk) to Short-term Credentials (STS tokens - secure, auto-expire). Least Privilege: Apply minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using * in Policies unless absolutely necessary. 2. Governance at Scale with AWS Organizations:\nHierarchical Structure: Divide the organization into Organizational Units (OUs) like Security, Shared Services, Workloads (Prod/Dev) to isolate risks. Service Control Policies (SCPs): This is the \u0026ldquo;Constitution\u0026rdquo; of the organization. SCPs establish Guardrails that block dangerous actions (e.g., prohibiting CloudTrail disablement, restricting Regions) that even Admin accounts cannot bypass. PART 3: VISIBILITY \u0026amp; DETECTION You cannot protect what you cannot see.\n1. Amazon GuardDuty - Intelligent Scout:\nUses Machine Learning to detect anomalies from 3 foundational data sources: CloudTrail (management events), VPC Flow Logs (network traffic), and DNS Logs (domain queries). Runtime Monitoring: Advanced feature that looks \u0026ldquo;deep\u0026rdquo; inside the operating system (via a lightweight Agent) to detect strange processes, file modifications, or privilege escalation behaviors. 2. AWS Security Hub - Command Center:\nSolves the \u0026ldquo;alert fatigue\u0026rdquo; problem using ASFF (AWS Security Finding Format). It normalizes alerts from GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie into a single JSON language. Acts as a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool, automatically checking if the system complies with CIS, PCI-DSS standards. PART 4: NETWORK SECURITY Building a \u0026ldquo;Digital Fortress\u0026rdquo; with a defense-in-depth strategy from the edge to the core.\n1. Fundamental Controls (VPC Fundamentals):\nSecurity Groups (Stateful): Apply Micro-segmentation. Instead of whitelisting IP addresses (which change easily), use Security Group Referencing (e.g., SG-DB only allows traffic from SG-App). NACLs (Stateless): Act as a coarse filtering layer at the Subnet boundary, used to block blacklisted IPs or untrusted subnets. 2. Advanced Defense (Advanced Filtering):\nDNS Firewall (Route 53 Resolver): Blocks connections to Command \u0026amp; Control (C2) servers right at the domain resolution step. This is a crucial choke point against malware (like the Mélofée case study). AWS Network Firewall: Next-gen firewall with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) capabilities. Stateless Engine: Fast filtering based on 5-tuple (IP/Port). Stateful Engine: Uses Suricata-compatible rules for Intrusion Prevention (IPS) and Domain filtering (FQDN) for Egress traffic. 3. Modern Network Architecture:\nUses AWS Transit Gateway with Native Network Firewall integration to simplify the network model, removing the complexity of routing through an \u0026ldquo;Inspection VPC\u0026rdquo;. Applies Active Threat Defense: Automatically syncs malicious IP lists from GuardDuty to Network Firewall for immediate blocking without manual intervention. PART 5: DATA PROTECTION Data is the ultimate asset that must be protected by encryption.\n1. Envelope Encryption:\nUnderstanding the AWS KMS mechanism: Master Key (resides in HSM) encrypts the Data Key, and the Data Key is what encrypts the actual data. This mechanism ensures high performance and absolute security. 2. Secrets Management:\nProblem: Hardcoding passwords in source code is a basic but common error. Solution: Use AWS Secrets Manager for storage and, more importantly, Automatic Rotation of Database passwords using Lambda. Applications always retrieve the latest password via API. 3. Infrastructure Encryption:\nUses AWS Nitro System: Encryption tasks are offloaded to specialized hardware (Nitro Cards), enabling data encryption without compromising the host server\u0026rsquo;s CPU performance (Zero Performance Impact). PART 6: INCIDENT RESPONSE When defense layers are breached, the response process determines the extent of the damage.\n1. Prevention Strategy (Sleep Better):\nGolden Rules: Eliminate long-lived SSH/Keys, Block Public S3 access, Default to Private Subnets. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Mandate all infrastructure changes via Code (Terraform/CDK) and approval processes (PR Review), completely eliminating manual changes (ClickOps) that cause configuration drift. 2. Standard 5-Step Process:\nPreparation: Have tools and Playbooks ready. Detection: Rely on CloudTrail and GuardDuty. Containment: \u0026ldquo;Jail\u0026rdquo; infected resources by changing Security Groups or revoking IAM permissions. Eradication \u0026amp; Recovery: Remove malware, restore from clean backups. Post-Incident: Learn lessons. 3. Automation is King:\nHumans cannot race against machine speed. Hands-on labs demonstrated the necessity of using EventBridge + Lambda to automatically isolate compromised EC2 instances or auto-remediate public S3 buckets in seconds. Conclusion The \u0026ldquo;Cloud Security \u0026amp; Operations Mastery\u0026rdquo; series has provided a comprehensive overview of building secure systems on AWS through key pillars:\nGovernance \u0026amp; Identity: The foundation of every security system starts with strict user management and organizational policies. Network \u0026amp; Monitoring: Establishing defense-in-depth layers and comprehensive visibility to detect potential threats. Data \u0026amp; Response: Protecting digital assets with encryption and readying automated incident response processes to ensure service continuity.

Text Generation Mechanism: Using the LLM\u0026rsquo;s language understanding and synthesis capabilities to generate natural responses. The goal of RAG is to provide the LLM with accurate, up-to-date, and specific context, helping the model overcome the limitations of static training data.\nWhy is RAG needed? Traditional LLM models often face 3 major problems that RAG can solve:\nInformation Updates (Freshness): The LLM does not need Re-training or Fine-tuning yet can still answer the latest information, simply by updating the search database. Data Ownership (Proprietary Data): Allows AI to answer questions regarding private enterprise data (internal documents, code base, customer information) that the original model does not know. Authenticity (Grounding): Minimizes \u0026ldquo;Hallucination\u0026rdquo; (AI fabricating information) by forcing the AI to cite or rely on actual text passages found. Operational Architecture The process of handling a question in RAG proceeds as follows:\nStep Name Action Description 1 Retrieval (Truy xuất) The system searches for text segments most relevant to the question in the data repository (usually using a Vector Database). 2 Augmentation (Tăng cường) Combine the user\u0026rsquo;s question + The data just found into a complete \u0026ldquo;prompt\u0026rdquo;. 3 Generation (Tạo sinh) Send that prompt to the AI (LLM) for it to synthesize and write out the final answer for the user.

Ask the exact same question as before: \u0026ldquo;What is the activation code for Project Omega?\u0026rdquo; Expected Result: The AI answers correctly: \u0026ldquo;The activation code is AWS-ROCKS-2025-SINGAPORE\u0026rdquo;. The AI cites the source as the secret-project.txt file. Conclusion You have just witnessed the true power of RAG!\nNo code editing required. No model retraining required. Simply Sync the data. Your Chatbot has become smarter and updated with the latest information in just a few simple steps. This is exactly why businesses choose this solution to build internal virtual assistants.\n"},{"uri":"https://danielleit241.github.io/aws-fcj-report/5-workshop/5.7-cleanup/","title":"Clean Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Target To avoid incurring unwanted costs after finishing the practice lab, we need to delete the created resources.\n⚠️ WARNING: Deleting the Knowledge Base DOES NOT automatically delete the Vector Store (OpenSearch Serverless).

Working Environment\nThe working environment is professional; members of the FCJ community are very friendly and open. In particular, the FCJ seniors as well as fellow FCJ members in my cohort were always ready to support and answer questions when my team and I faced difficulties in designing and using AWS services. Because of that help, I realized my mistakes earlier. Instead of having to pay a large amount of money [for cloud costs], that assistance helped me gain more knowledge with the only trade-off being the questions asked. The workspace is neat and comfortable, and the learning spirit of my peers motivated me to be more focused and determined with the goals I had set.\nHowever, I think that next time, if possible, there should be a fixed schedule so that team members can come to the office more easily instead of competing [for slots] as is currently the case. This would allow everyone in the group to access and exchange ideas directly more easily, as some members did not have time to get to know each other outside and could only interact online initially.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe Mentors are extremely dedicated and conscientious; not only is the quality high, but the number of Mentors is also significant, and they are ready to support us extensively. Regardless of the time—sometimes even at 2-3 AM—they still provided feedback so we could make edits in time for the deadline. Not stopping at support, they also shared useful knowledge accumulated through their work experience, which are invaluable lessons that FCJ brought to me. What I like about them is that they spark curiosity regarding the mistakes I made during the learning and working process. Instead of giving the answer, they guided me to official documentation so I could find the answer myself and deeply ingrain those mistakes so as not to repeat them next time.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe work I performed was like the missing puzzle piece from my studies at university. Developing products locally is different from developing a product that is more user-oriented, which requires handling more issues, especially regarding security as well as software consistency. Doing harder and more advanced tasks in my field of study has helped me no longer feel \u0026ldquo;afraid\u0026rdquo; of working with them. Thanks to this, I both consolidated my programming knowledge and learned DevOps skills and other soft skills such as teamwork, communication, etc., which has helped me develop significantly in the present and even for the future.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills, not only regarding my major but also other soft skills. I got to work with new people, with people not from the same major, thereby gaining different perspectives of each major as well as skills through sharing among group members. I attended many cool events hosted by seniors with extensive experience in large corporations, learning how they apply AI to work as well as other advanced programming skills, helping me better orient the career I am pursuing.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive; everyone supports each other enthusiastically with a primary spirit of learning and sharing knowledge. During work, everyone is extremely focused, but there are also times that are extremely fun. When deadlines approach, everyone strives together, supporting each other regardless of position; those who are finished help those who are not, and those who know help those who don\u0026rsquo;t. As long as there is a problem, everyone will support solving that problem as quickly and effectively as possible. This helped me easily integrate with everyone, even just in the role of an intern.\nAdditional Questions The thing I am most satisfied with during the internship period is the spirit of the FCJers, a spirit ready to share everything within their knowledge, leaving no one behind. Such a spirit helped me partly understand that FCJ is not just a program, but an entire community eager to learn, ready to share new knowledge with interns—not just me, but many others who have not yet had access to it.\n"},{"uri":"https://danielleit241.github.io/aws-fcj-report/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://danielleit241.github.io/aws-fcj-report/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
